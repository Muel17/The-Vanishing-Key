# The-Vanishing-Key
Good luck for more hint will be updated in discord :)

Welcome tho Second Question!!

In 2023, a group of informatics students at a president university participated in a secret project called Project Who the best?. The goal of the project was to create an unhackable encryption method to safeguard critical academic research. However, during a late-night coding session, the lead developer, Alex, mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind only a cryptic message on a whiteboard.

The message read:

"In the room of two truths and one lie,
The key you'll find if you know why.
Numbers repeat, and cycles deceive,
Think like the clock, and you'll retrieve.
Beware of haste; the solution hides,
In mirrored steps where logic resides."

have you solve riddle and cryptography before???
